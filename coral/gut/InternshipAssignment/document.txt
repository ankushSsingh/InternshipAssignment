My name is Ankush Singh, and I am a final year CSE UG student at IIT Kanpur. It was a good overall learning experience. I started the assignment late on 26th evening. As I also have final semester exams in my college. So I could not devote enough time in the assignment.


I had an experience with WebApp development from last semester. We implemented the App in NodeJS-Express Architecture but with mongodb as the DBMS. That helped me here as I implemented the NodeJS-Express architecture with MySQL. 


Learnings ? I was not familiar with REST based Web services before this assignment. So I learned about it during the assignment. It was a new thing and will surely help me in the near future.

Challenges? Turned out that the only challenging thing for me was that the DATABASE was not getting connected And it surely is now also not connecting :( .Had it been connected, I would have the app ready. I have submitted the broken app as I had no other choice. Please help me if you could understand why I am getting this error, whenever my app.js tries to connect to the amazon database.

I surfed web about possible causes:
*bind-address not correctly mentioned 
*SQL Limits Check Violated
*Database name error

but their seem to be something else. I still don't know what

Any new changes I would suggest?
I think the assignment was good enough to analyze anyone's aptitude in NODEJS Development.
